# Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Changes Made for Public Deployment

Your app has been updated to support **user-provided API keys**, making it perfect for public deployment where you don't want to pay for everyone's OpenAI usage!

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. Frontend (pages/index.tsx)

**Added:**
- ✅ API Key input field (password type for security)
- ✅ "Remember my API key" checkbox with localStorage
- ✅ Info banner explaining BYOK model
- ✅ Security message ("never sent to our servers")
- ✅ Link to OpenAI API key signup
- ✅ Auto-load saved key from localStorage on page load
- ✅ API key validation before submission

**User Experience:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔑 Bring Your Own API Key               │
│ This is a public tool. You need your    │
│ own OpenAI API key. Get one at:         │
│ platform.openai.com/api-keys            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

OpenAI API Key *
[sk-...                                  ]
☐ Remember my API key (stored locally)
Your API key is sent directly to OpenAI
and is never sent to our servers
```

### 2. Backend (pages/api/verify.ts)

**Removed:**
- ❌ `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` dependency
- ❌ Environment variable check

**Added:**
- ✅ `apiKey` parameter in request type
- ✅ API key validation (required, must start with "sk-")
- ✅ Use user's API key instead of server key
- ✅ Better error messages for invalid keys

**Before:**
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { url, prompt, apiKey } = req.body;

// Validate API key
if (!apiKey || !apiKey.startsWith('sk-')) {
  return error;
}

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: apiKey, // User's key
});
```

### 3. Documentation Updates

**Updated Files:**
- ✅ README.md - Added BYOK info, removed env setup
- ✅ DEPLOYMENT.md - Simplified (no API key needed)
- ✅ QUICK_START.md - Updated usage instructions
- ✅ Created PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT.md - Complete public deployment guide

**New Documentation:**
- ✅ PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT.md - Comprehensive guide for sharing publicly
- ✅ BYOK_CHANGES.md - This file (summary of changes)

### 4. Environment Variables

**Before:**
```bash
# Required for deployment
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

**After:**
```bash
# No environment variables needed! 🎉
# Users provide their own keys
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### What's Protected

1. **No Server-Side Storage**
   - API keys are never saved on your server
   - No database storage of keys
   - No server-side logs of keys

2. **Direct OpenAI Communication**
   ```
   User Browser → Your Server → OpenAI
        ↓                           ↑
     (API Key in request body)      |
                                    |
                    (Key sent directly to OpenAI)
   ```

3. **Optional Client-Side Storage**
   - Users choose to save key in localStorage
   - Only stored in their own browser
   - Can be deleted anytime

4. **API Key Validation**
   - Format check (must start with "sk-")
   - Required field validation
   - Clear error messages

### What Users See

✅ **Transparent Privacy**

- Clear where key is stored
